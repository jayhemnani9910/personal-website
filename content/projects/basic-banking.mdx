  context: |
    This was one of my first complete web applications, built during my internship to learn the fundamentals of full-stack development. The goal was to understand the complete request-response cycle, database interactions, and basic security considerations in a controlled learning environment.

    While the scope was intentionally limited (basic CRUD operations for banking transactions), the project served as a practical introduction to server-side programming, SQL databases, and user authentication - concepts I'd only known theoretically before this.

  architecture: |
    Simple MVC-inspired structure with PHP handling both routing and business logic:

    - **Models**: Direct SQL queries for user authentication and transaction records
    - **Views**: HTML templates with embedded PHP for dynamic content rendering
    - **Controllers**: PHP scripts processing form submissions and coordinating database operations

    The database schema included basic tables for users (credentials, account balances) and transactions (sender, receiver, amount, timestamp). No complex relationships or normalization beyond what was necessary for the demo.

  components:
    - name: "Authentication System"
      description: "Login/logout flow with session management. Used PHP sessions to maintain user state and basic password hashing (md5 at the time - learned about bcrypt later)."

    - name: "Transaction Module"
      description: "Form-based money transfers between accounts. Implemented basic validation to prevent negative balances and self-transfers."

    - name: "Transaction History"
      description: "Simple ledger view showing incoming and outgoing transfers. Basic SQL JOINs to fetch related user data."

    - name: "Admin Dashboard"
      description: "Overview page showing all users and their balances. First exposure to role-based access control concepts."

  dataFlow: |
    1. User submits login credentials via POST request
    2. PHP script queries MySQL database to verify credentials
    3. On success, create session and redirect to dashboard
    4. For transfers: validate inputs, check sender balance, execute dual UPDATE queries (debit sender, credit receiver)
    5. Insert transaction record for audit trail
    6. Reload dashboard with updated balances

    All database operations were synchronous with direct query execution. No ORM, prepared statements were manually implemented after learning about SQL injection.

  keyDecisions:
    - decision: "Choosing procedural PHP over frameworks"
      rationale: "Wanted to understand the fundamentals before using abstractions like Laravel. This helped me appreciate what frameworks do under the hood."

    - decision: "Manual SQL queries instead of ORM"
      rationale: "Needed to learn SQL syntax, table relationships, and query optimization basics. Wrote JOIN queries by hand to understand database operations."

    - decision: "Session-based authentication"
      rationale: "Simplest authentication mechanism to implement. Learned about session cookies, server-side storage, and state management."

    - decision: "Minimal frontend styling"
      rationale: "Focus was on backend logic. Used basic HTML/CSS to make it functional but not fancy - this was about learning server-side concepts."

  learnings:
    - learning: "Security fundamentals"
      description: "First real exposure to SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, and why input validation matters. Initially wrote vulnerable code, then learned to use prepared statements and sanitize outputs."

    - learning: "Database design basics"
      description: "Understanding primary keys, foreign keys, and why atomicity matters in financial transactions. Learned the hard way about race conditions when two transfers happened simultaneously."

    - learning: "State management"
      description: "How sessions work, cookie-based authentication, and the stateless nature of HTTP. This foundation helped later when learning about JWT tokens and modern auth patterns."

    - learning: "Form handling and validation"
      description: "Server-side validation, error messaging, and user feedback. Learned why client-side validation alone isn't enough."

    - learning: "Development workflow"
      description: "Setting up local PHP/MySQL environment (XAMPP), debugging with var_dump(), and basic version control with Git. First project where I used branches and commits meaningfully."
