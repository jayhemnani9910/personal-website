challenge: "Build production-ready system tracking web content changes over time with versioned snapshots, intelligent discovery, and instant search across thousands of archived pages."
solution:
  - "ArchiveBox integration with custom crawl scheduler: discovers pages via sitemap + internal links, maintains 50K+ versioned snapshots."
  - "Content hashing with SHA-256 diff detection triggering instant alerts on changes, reducing false positives by ~80% vs simple HTML comparison."
  - "SQLite FTS5 full-text search enabling sub-second queries across entire archive history with ranking."
impact:
  - "Monitors 100+ websites automatically every 2 hours, processing 1,200+ snapshots daily with zero manual intervention."
  - "Production deployment: Docker containerization, systemd auto-restart, Prometheus metrics tracking uptime (99.8%) and performance."
  - "Reduced content monitoring overhead from hours of manual checking to zero with automated diff alerts."
