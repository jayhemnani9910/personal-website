tech: ["Python", "Kafka", "Airflow", "TimescaleDB/Postgres", "Dash", "SQL"]
challenge: "Unify real-time ticks and batch OHLC data into a single, query-friendly warehouse with reproducible jobs."
solution:
  - "Kafka topics (ticks, news) for near-real-time ingestion; producers buffer/retry with idempotent writes."
  - "Airflow schedules batch ingests & backfills, orchestrates validation and dimensional loads."
  - "TimescaleDB hypertables for ticks; star schema (FactPrices + dimensions) for analytics."
  - "Dash UI: time-window filters, rolling indicators (SMA/EMA), intraday heatmaps."
impact:
  - "Single source of truth for intraday + historical; reproducible backfills."
  - "Interactive dashboards with smooth time-window slicing."
  - "Clear lineage for KPIs and derived indicators."
