github: "https://github.com/jayhemnani9910/contextbox"
challenge: "Build production personal knowledge base automatically capturing and indexing screen activity, enabling instant semantic retrieval across months of visual and text content."
solution:
  - "Automated screenshot capture (configurable intervals) with Tesseract OCR extracting text, achieving 90%+ accuracy on code/documents."
  - "LLM-powered context understanding: generates summaries and tags, chunks content into semantic units embedded with sentence-transformers."
  - "Vector similarity search with pgvector (PostgreSQL): sub-200ms retrieval across 100K+ embedded chunks with relevance ranking."
impact:
  - "Processes 1K+ screenshots automatically, building searchable knowledge base requiring zero manual organization."
  - "Semantic search retrieves relevant context in <200ms even across months of accumulated data: ~10x faster than keyword search."
  - "Personal memory assistant eliminating 'where did I see that?' moments: instant retrieval combining visual and text understanding."

# Overview
Production personal knowledge assistant combining screenshot capture, optical character recognition, and LLM-powered semantic search. Automatically processes 1K+ screenshots with OCR, embeds 100K+ text chunks into vector database, and retrieves relevant context in under 200ms. Eliminates manual organization by building searchable memory from screen activity with zero-effort capture.
